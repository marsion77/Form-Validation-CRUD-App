# 📝 Form Validation CRUD App

This is a responsive web application that allows users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** user data through a form. It uses **Bootstrap** for UI styling, **JavaScript** for logic, and **Regex** for real-time form validation. Data is stored and persisted using **localStorage**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The user fills out a form with fields like name, email, phone, etc.
- As they type, inputs are validated using **regular expressions**
- On successful submission:
  - The data is added to local storage
  - It appears in a table below the form
- Each record has **Edit** and **Delete** buttons:
  - **Edit** loads the data back into the form for modification
  - **Delete** removes the record permanently
- All data persists even after page reloads, thanks to localStorage
